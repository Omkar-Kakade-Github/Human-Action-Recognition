# Human-Action-Recognition

Dataset Summary
A dataset from kaggle. origin: https://dphi.tech/challenges/data-sprint-76-human-activity-recognition/233/data

Introduction
- The dataset features 15 different classes of Human Activities.
- The dataset contains about 12k+ labelled images including the validation images.
- Each image has only one human activity category and are saved in separate folders of the labelled classes

PROBLEM STATEMENT
- Human Action Recognition (HAR) aims to understand human behavior and assign a label to each action. It has a wide range of applications, and therefore has been attracting increasing attention in the field of computer vision. Human actions can be represented using various data modalities, such as RGB, skeleton, depth, infrared, point cloud, event stream, audio, acceleration, radar, and WiFi signal, which encode different sources of useful yet distinct information and have various advantages depending on the application scenarios.
- Consequently, lots of existing works have attempted to investigate different types of approaches for HAR using various modalities.
- The Task is to build an Image Classification Model using CNN that classifies to which class of activity a human is performing.

METHODOLOGY
- Developed a Human Action Recognition (HAR) model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with EfficientNetV2S through transfer learning to classify 15 different human activities.
- Achieved a final accuracy of 81% on the training set and 77% on the validation set, demonstrating the model's capability in accurately identifying human actions across various data modalities.
- Implemented state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision to enhance model performance and effectively interpret human behavior.
